## Group Feedback
Great work so far! You've implemented the design with good use of java OOP. 
The teamwork is great from your git commit history.
The interfaces are applied clearly and smartly. I can see the clear seperation of
concern in your code. Please keep doing this!
The game itself is yet to be playable, but I can see a very nice skeleton at this
point. I'm looking forward to your next deliverable :)

By the way, can you remove "gittest" and "test" folder in your `src` directory?
The `src` directory should be used explicitly for source code.
