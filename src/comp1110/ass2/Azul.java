     * Given a shared state string, determine if it is well-formed.
     * Note: you don't need to consider validity for this task.
     * A sharedState is well-formed if it satisfies the following conditions.
     * <p>
     * [turn][factories][centre][bag][discard]
     * where [turn][factories], [centre], [bag] and [discard] are replaced by the
     * corresponding small string as described below.
     * <p>
     * 0. [turn] The Turn substring is one character 'A'-'D' representing a
     * player, which indicates that it is this player's turn to make the next
     * drafting move. (In a two-player game, the turn substring can only take
     * the values 'A' or 'B').
     * <p>
     * 1. [factories] The factories substring begins with an 'F'
     * and is followed by a collection of *up to* 5 5-character factory strings
     * representing each factory.
     * Each factory string is defined in the following way:
     * 1st character is a sequential digit '0' to '4' - representing the
     * factory number.
     * 2nd - 5th characters are 'a' to 'e', alphabetically - representing
     * the tiles.
     * A factory may have between 0 and 4 tiles. If a factory has 0 tiles,
     * it does not appear in the factories string.
     * Factory strings are ordered by factory number.
     * For example: given the string "F1aabc2abbb4ddee": Factory 1 has tiles
     * 'aabc', Factory 2 has tiles 'abbb', Factory 4 has tiles 'ddee', and
     * Factories 0 and 4 are empty.
     * <p>
     * 2. [centre] The centre substring starts with a 'C'
     * This is followed by *up to* 15 characters.
     * Each character is 'a' to 'e', alphabetically - representing a tile
     * in the centre.
     * The centre string is sorted alphabetically.
     * For example: "Caaabcdde" The Centre contains three 'a' tiles, one 'b'
     * tile, one 'c' tile, two 'd' tile and one 'e' tile.
     * <p>
     * 3. [bag] The bag substring starts with a 'B'
     * and is followed by 5 2-character substrings
     * 1st substring represents the number of 'a' tiles, from 0 - 20.
     * 2nd substring represents the number of 'b' tiles, from 0 - 20.
     * 3rd substring represents the number of 'c' tiles, from 0 - 20.
     * 4th substring represents the number of 'd' tiles, from 0 - 20.
     * 5th substring represents the number of 'e' tiles, from 0 - 20.
     * <p>
     * For example: "B0005201020" The bag contains zero 'a' tiles, five 'b'
     * tiles, twenty 'c' tiles, ten 'd' tiles and twenty 'e' tiles.
     * 4. [discard] The discard substring starts with a 'D'
     * and is followed by 5 2-character substrings defined the same as the
     * bag substring.
     * For example: "D0005201020" The bag contains zero 'a' tiles, five 'b'
     * tiles, twenty 'c' tiles, ten 'd' tiles, and twenty 'e' tiles.
     *
     * @param sharedState the shared state - factories, bag and discard.
     * @return true if sharedState is well-formed, otherwise return false

     * Given a playerState, determine if it is well-formed.

     * A playerString follows this pattern: [player][score][mosaic][storage][floor]
     * where [player], [score], [mosaic], [storage] and [floor] are replaced by
     * a corresponding substring as described below.
     * Each playerString is sorted by Player i.e. Player A appears before Player B.
     * <p>
     * 1. [player] The player substring is one character 'A' to 'D' -
     * representing the Player
     * <p>
     * 2. [score] The score substring is one or more digits between '0' and '9' -
     * representing the score
     * <p>
     * 3. [mosaic] The Mosaic substring begins with a 'M'
     * Which is followed by *up to* 25 3-character strings.
     * Each 3-character string is defined as follows:
     * 1st character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
     * 2nd character is '0' to '4' - representing the row.
     * 3rd character is '0' to '4' - representing the column.
     * The Mosaic substring is ordered first by row, then by column.
     * That is, "a01" comes before "a10".
     * <p>
     * 4. [storage] The Storage substring begins with an 'S'
     * and is followed by *up to* 5 3-character strings.
     * Each 3-character string is defined as follows:
     * 1st character is '0' to '4' - representing the row - each row number must only appear once.
     * 2nd character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
     * 3rd character is '0' to '5' - representing the number of tiles stored in that row.
     * Each 3-character string is ordered by row number.
     * <p>
     * 5. [floor] The Floor substring begins with an 'F'
     * and is followed by *up to* 7 characters in alphabetical order.
     * Each character is 'a' to 'f' - where 'f' represents the first player token.
     * There is only one first player token.
     * <p>
     * An entire playerState for 2 players might look like this:
     * "A20Ma02a13b00e42S2a13e44a1FaabbeB30Mc01b11d21S0e12b2F"
