### Comments 
The codes are well-formed and have a good structure, comments are also accurate.
The program decomposition is appropriate, have divided some complex statements into 
different classes. Methods and variables are named properly and consistently.
In the code, the turn is only changed between Player A and B, so it would not function 
correctly, when we want to more than two players to play the game at the same time.
